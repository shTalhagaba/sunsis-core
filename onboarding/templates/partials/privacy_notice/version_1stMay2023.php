<h4 class="text-bold"><u>Privacy Notice</u></h4>

<p>
    This privacy notice is issued by the Department for Education (DfE) on behalf of the Secretary of State 
    for the Department of Education (DfE) to inform learners about the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) and how their 
    personal information is used in the ILR. Your personal information is used by the DfE to exercise our functions under 
    article 6(1)(e) of the UK GDPR and to meet our statutory responsibilities, including under the Apprenticeships, Skills, 
    Children and Learning Act 2009. Our lawful basis for using your special category personal data is covered under Substantial 
    Public Interest based in law (Article 9(2)(g)) of GDPR legislation. This processing is under Section 54 of the Further and 
    Higher Education Act (1992).
</p>
<p>
    The ILR collects data about learners and learning undertaken. Publicly funded colleges, training organisations, local authorities, 
    and employers (FE providers) must collect and return the data to the Department for Education (DfE) each year under the terms of a funding agreement, contract 
    or grant agreement. It helps ensure that public money distributed through the Department for Education (DfE) is being spent in line with government targets. 
    It is also used for education, training, employment, and well-being purposes, including research.
</p>
<p>
    We retain your ILR learner data for 20 years for operational purposes (e.g. to fund your learning and to publish official statistics). 
    Your personal data is then retained in our research databases until you are aged 80 years so that it can be used for long-term research 
    purposes. For more information about the ILR and the data collected, please see the ILR specification at 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/individualised-learner-record-ilr">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/individualised-learner-record-ilr</a>
</p>
<p>
    ILR data is shared with third parties where it complies with DfE data sharing procedures and where the law allows it. 
    The DfE and the English European Social Fund (ESF) Managing Authority (or agents acting on their behalf) may contact 
    learners to carry out research and evaluation to inform the effectiveness of training.

        <p>
            This privacy notice is issued by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) on behalf of the Secretary of State
            for the Department of Education (DfE) to inform learners about the Individualised Learner Record (ILR) and how their
            personal information is used in the ILR. Your personal information is used by the DfE to exercise our functions under
            article 6(1)(e) of the UK GDPR and to meet our statutory responsibilities, including under the Apprenticeships, Skills,
            Children and Learning Act 2009. Our lawful basis for using your special category personal data is covered under Substantial

        </p>
        <p>
            The ILR collects data about learners and learning undertaken. Publicly funded colleges, training organisations, local authorities,
            and employers (FE providers) must collect and return the data to the ESFA each year under the terms of a funding agreement, contract
            or grant agreement. It helps ensure that public money distributed through the ESFA is being spent in line with government targets.
            It is also used for education, training, employment, and well-being purposes, including research.
        </p>
        <p>
            We retain your ILR learner data for 20 years for operational purposes (e.g. to fund your learning and to publish official statistics).
            Your personal data is then retained in our research databases until you are aged 80 years so that it can be used for long-term research
            purposes. For more information about the ILR and the data collected, please see the ILR specification at

        </p>
        <p>
            ILR data is shared with third parties where it complies with DfE data sharing procedures and where the law allows it.
            The DfE and the English European Social Fund (ESF) Managing Authority (or agents acting on their behalf) may contact
            learners to carry out research and evaluation to inform the effectiveness of training.

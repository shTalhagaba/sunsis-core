								<p>It doesn't matter how big or small the lack of communication is poor communication will strain the productivity of the company. Awareness of problems in communication is the first step toward solving them.</p>
								<p>If communication skills are poor, employees lack enthusiasm, motivation, creativity and inspiration in doing their jobs and will question why they are doing them. If employees are given

								<p><b>Effects of Negative Communication in the Workplace</b></p>
								<p>Negative communication includes rumours, misinformation, misinterpretation, incomplete information and employee slander (making false and damaging statements about someone).</p>
								<p>While some are done on purpose such as employee slander, other negative communication occurs without any intent of malice, such as unknowingly relaying incomplete information.</p>
								<p>One side effect to negative communication is workplace conflict. When one employee spreads false rumours about another staff member, the result can often be a verbal or physical altercation between the two parties.</p>
								<p>Negative communication, whether intended or not, can have an effect on staff morale. Persistent intended negative communication can add stress to the workplace that makes it difficult to develop a productive work environment.</p>
								<p>Unintentional negative communication can be forgiven up to a point, but when it becomes a regular occurrence, it can lead to a drop in employee confidence in the company.</p>
								<p>An atmosphere of negative communication can be extremely difficult for a workplace to recover from. Intentional and unintentional negative communication erodes trust, to the point where information must be checked several times before it is acted upon.</p>

								<p>The difference between the words people speak and our understanding of what they are saying comes from non?verbal communication, otherwise known as "body language." By developing your awareness of the

								<p>There are sometimes subtle – and sometimes not so subtle – movements, gestures, facial expressions and even shifts in our whole bodies that indicate something is going on. The way we talk, walk, sit and stand all
									say something about us, and whatever is happening on the inside can be reflected on the outside.</p>
								<p>By becoming more aware of this body language and understanding what it might mean, you can learn to read people more easily. This puts you in a better position to communicate effectively with them.
									What's more, by increasing your understanding of others, you can also become more aware of the messages that you convey to them.</p>
								<p>There are times when we send mixed messages – we say one thing yet our body language reveals something different. This non?verbal language will affect how we act and react to others, and how they react to us.</p>

								<p><b>Body language skills</b> are really important in different situations. As well as deciphering other people's body language, you can use this knowledge to convey feelings that you're not actually experiencing.</p>

								<p>Active listening is a method of listening and responding to another person that encourages them to communicate clearly and fully. It is listener orientated and based on a 70:30 rule, meaning you focus your
									efforts on the speaker and aim to talk no more than 30% of the time whilst encouraging them to make up 70% of the conversation.</p>
							</div>

						</div>

						<div class="row">

							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<p><b>1. Be Non Judgmental and Pause Your Inner Voice:</b></p>
								<p>There is a good listening quote that says:</p>
								<blockquote><p>"People don't listen to what you say. People listen to what they say to themselves about what you say."</p></blockquote>
								<p>We can find ourselves evaluating conversations and hearing our 'inner voice'; the part of the conscious mind that is constantly processing and judging information.</p>
								<p>A common trait in human communication is to constantly take in and judge what is being said, which can be useful in certain circumstances, but not when practicing true active listening, as this can lead to two problems.</p>
								<p>Firstly it encourages premature evaluation of what is being said. This is because the average attention span during a conversation is only a
									matter of a few minutes (10 to 12) and people tend to reach a conclusion before this time.</p>
								<p>Secondly forming and voicing a judgment can stifle the speaker and often miss the true point being made.</p>
								<p><b>2. Body Language:</b></p>
								<p>Positive body language is important in building rapport and getting the talker to open up. Try to lean slightly forward when the person is talking, maintain eye contact and nod your head at key
									points. This sounds a bit forced so in practice it's important it's done naturally.</p>
								<p>Good listening body language demonstrates 'attendance' in a conversation. It shows the speaker you are interested, encouraging them to talk further.</p>
								<p><b>3. Seek to understand before you seek to be understood:</b></p>
								<p>When we enter a conversation with the aim of understanding the other person, rather than be understood ourselves, our intention will be to listen.</p>
								<p>Therefore try listening to understand, rather than to respond.</p>
								<p><b>4. Paraphrase:</b></p>
								<p>You can really demonstrate active listening by paraphrasing and explaining back to the speaker what you've just heard.</p>
								<p>This both checks your understanding and demonstrates 'attendance' to the speaker – i.e. that you're genuinely interested in their needs and have heard what they are saying.</p>
								<p><b>5. Acknowledgement</b></p>
								<p>A fast and highly effective way of practicing active listening is by acknowledging to the speaker you've heard what they have said.</p>
								<p>This makes the speaker feel understood.</p>
								<p>When people feel truly understood by you, they believe you to be perceptive and intelligent, which is also a great rapport builder.</p>
								<p>In difficult conversations feelings crave acknowledgement. And unless they receive the acknowledgement they need, feelings will cause trouble.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<p><b>How to acknowledge effectively:</b></p>
								<p>Imagine a scenario where another team member tells you they feel let down, and even lied to, by the manager regarding targets.
									If you were to reply "I haven't had any problems so don't worry about it." This is not an effective acknowledgement. Instead it would be more useful to reply: "It sounds like you’re really
									upset about this and if I was in your shoes I would feel concerned too."</p>
								<p>Of course there is no one perfect thing to say in every situation, and at times you can use your body
									language to convey acknowledgment. But the key to successful acknowledgement is to verbally recognise people's feelings and invisible questions. We must also acknowledge before moving onto problem solving</p>
								<p>In fact acknowledging and understanding are completely different from agreeing.</p>
								<p>This situation may happen with colleagues in store but it is also likely to happen with customers</p>

								<p><b>6. Use Silence and Questions Effectively:</b></p>
								<p>As an active listener silence is a valuable tool. In many cases you will learn more by maintaining your silence than asking questions.
									This is because your silence allows the speaker time to explain them self, helping you identify the true issues.</p>
								<p>Whilst maintaining silence is important, asking relevant questions is also an effective way of enhancing communication,
									and a key part of active listening. As mentioned earlier, ensure the other person is speaking around 70% of the time, meaning you need to make your 30% as effective as possible.</p>
								<p>Use open questions (what, when, where, why and how) if you want someone to expand and closed questions
									(such as do or if) when you need to narrow the conversation down. Only ever ask one question at a time, more confuses conversation.</p>
								<p><b>7. Empathy:</b></p>
								<p>Empathy is a fundamental skill that an active listener should have. Different in nature to sympathy, it is the
									ability to recognise and share feelings expressed by another. Empathy also allows people in a conversation to establish a connection and build trust.</p>
